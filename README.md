# CLASSIX
A MATLAB implementation of CLASSIX, a fast and explainable clustering method based on sorting

There are various ways to run CLASSIX in MATLAB and this folder contains several files demonstrating this.

If you are new to CLASSIX, start with GET_STARTED.mlx or GET_STARTED.html.

**Acknowledgements:** We are grateful to Mike Croucher and Maria Gavilan-Alfonso from MathWorks who have assisted us with enabling CLASSIX for MATLAB users, and have also directly contributed to several files in this repo.
